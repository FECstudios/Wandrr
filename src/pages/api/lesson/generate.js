ðŸ“‹ REQUIREMENTS:
- Infer the most relevant country and topic from: "${prompt}"
- If ambiguous, choose the most practical interpretation for travelers
- Difficulty: ${difficulty}/3 (${difficultyGuide[difficulty]})
- Format: ${lessonType}
- Target: International travelers seeking authentic cultural understanding

ðŸŽ¯ QUALITY STANDARDS:
âœ… Questions must be PRACTICAL and scenario-based
âœ… Use REAL situations travelers actually encounter
âœ… Include specific cultural context and reasoning
âœ… Make explanations educational and memorable
âœ… Ensure cultural accuracy and sensitivity
âœ… Create engaging, story-driven questions

ðŸ“š QUESTION GUIDELINES:
${lessonType === 'multiple_choice' ? `
â€¢ Craft 4 realistic options that could genuinely confuse travelers
â€¢ Include 1 correct answer and 3 plausible but wrong choices
â€¢ Make distractors educational (common misconceptions)
â€¢ Avoid obvious wrong answers` : `
â€¢ Create statements that test genuine cultural understanding
â€¢ Address common traveler misconceptions
â€¢ Include nuanced cultural truths that surprise people`}

ðŸŒŸ ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES:
- Start questions with scenario contexts ("You're at a restaurant...", "When visiting a temple...")
- Use specific examples rather than generic statements
- Include helpful cultural insights in explanations
- Reference local customs, traditions, or social expectations
- Make it relevant to the user's request: "${prompt}"

ðŸŽ¨ EXAMPLES BY DIFFICULTY:

BEGINNER Example:
{
  "type": "multiple_choice",
  "country": "Thailand",
  "topic": "Temple Etiquette",
  "question": "You're visiting a Buddhist temple in Bangkok. What should you do before entering the main prayer hall?",
  "options": ["Remove your shoes and hat", "Make a small donation", "Light an incense stick", "Take photos of the Buddha statue"],
  "answer": "Remove your shoes and hat",
  "explanation": "Removing shoes and hats shows respect in Buddhist temples. Your feet are considered the lowest part of the body, so footwear must never touch holy ground. Head coverings are also removed as a sign of humility.",
  "xp": 10
}

INTERMEDIATE Example:
{
  "type": "true_false",
  "country": "Germany",
  "topic": "Social Norms",
  "question": "In Germany, being exactly on time for social gatherings is considered fashionably late.",
  "answer": "false",
  "explanation": "Germans value punctuality extremely highly. Arriving exactly on time or even 5-10 minutes early is expected and shows respect. Being late to social events, even by 10 minutes, can be seen as disrespectful and inconsiderate.",
  "xp": 10
}

ADVANCED Example:
{
  "type": "multiple_choice",
  "country": "Japan",
  "topic": "Business Customs",
  "question": "At a Japanese business meeting, when your counterpart presents their business card (meishi), you should:",
  "options": ["Receive with both hands, read it carefully, and place it respectfully on the table", "Take it with one hand and immediately put it in your wallet", "Accept it casually and set it aside to focus on the meeting", "Examine it briefly and hand over your card simultaneously"],
  "answer": "Receive with both hands, read it carefully, and place it respectfully on the table",
  "explanation": "The meishi exchange is a crucial ritual in Japanese business culture. Receive with both hands, study it respectfully (showing you value the person), and place it carefully on the table in front of you. Never write on it, fold it, or put it away carelessly - it represents the person's honor.",
